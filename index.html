	<h1>Welcome! My name is Amanda.</h1>
	<h2>Some facts about me.</h2>
	<ul>
    <li>I've lived in the same house my entire life.</li>
	  <li>My father, my brother, and I were all born in the year of the tiger.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Educational and Professional Background</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I graduated from Lake Stevens High School in Lake Stevens, WA in 2004.</li>
    <li>From Fall 2004 through Spring 2012 I attended Everett Community College in Everett Washington.</li>
    <li>At EvCC I majored in Accounting, then changed to Elementary Education, and finally settled on
  Computer Information Systems.</li>
    <li>I changed my major to Computer Information Systems Fall 2008.</li>
    <li>I completed most of the CIS 2-year transfer degree, but ran into a roadblock when my faculty adviser passed away.</li>
    <li>To gain hands on experience in the technical field I have worked as an IT contractor since Summer 2012.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Professional/Career Goals</h2>
  <p>In college I took an introductary programming class where in we used Python, which I fell in love with.
  I am very analytically minded, and have an almost extreme case of attention-to-detail.  Spelling errors, grammar errors, 
  and errors of omission, just seem to jump out at me.  I would like to do something, career wise, where my idiosyncrasies
  are considered a major boon and asset.</p>

<!--As a prospective job seeker, I want to consider adopting additional features that I have seen in the 'About Me' projects made by others, so that my 'About Me' can become more thorough and interesting than my original conception.
As a prospective job seeker, I was to use CSS to creatively and tastefully style and layout my page.-->
