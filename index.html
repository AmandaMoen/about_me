	<h1>Welcome! My name is Amanda.</h1>
	<h2>Some facts about me.</h2>
	<p>I've lived in the same house my entire life.</p>
	<p>My father, my brother, and I were all born in the year of the tiger.</p>

  <h2>My Educational and Professional Background</h2>
  <p>I graduated from Lake Stevens High School in Lake Stevens, WA in 2004.</p>
  <p>From Fall 2004 through Spring 2012 I attended Everett Community College in Everett Washington.</p>
  <p>At EvCC I majored in Accounting, then changed to Elementary Education, and finally settled on
  Computer Information Systems.</p>
  <p>I changed my major to Computer Information Systems Fall 2008.</p>
  <p>I completed most of the CIS 2-year transfer degree, but ran into a roadblock when my faculty adviser passed away.</p>
  <p>To gain hands on experience in the technical field I have worked as an IT contractor since Summer 2012.</p>

  <h2>My Professional/Career Goals</h2>
  <p>In college I took an introductary programming class where in we used Python, which I fell in love with.
  I am very analytically minded, and have an almost extreme case of attention-to-detail.  Spelling errors, grammar errors, 
  and errors of omission, just seem to jump out at me.  I would like to do something, career wise, where my idiosyncrasies
  are considered a major boon and asset.</p>
